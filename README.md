# Geoty-Website-Project
Web application allowing Geocache players to map their finds.

The website uses **localStorage API** and **Leaflet geolocation API**

The app firstly asks you for your localization. Then it moves the map near your place.

It allows the user to add new geopoints on a map and asign them a name, difficulty, size, terrain and date info. The points are then listed and can be searched on a map by clicking them.
